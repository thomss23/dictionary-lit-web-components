## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5  
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow 
- [Lit 3](https://lit.dev/) - JS library

### What I learned

The purpose of this project was to get better understanding about [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) and dive deep into the Lit framework, understanding its core concepts and best practices.

Throughout the development of this side project, I've immersed myself in the dynamic world of Lit components, uncovering the nuances of state management, data fetching from REST APIs, and the art of updating component states seamlessly. Additionally, delving into the realm of styling, event listening, and understanding the exposure of ES6 classes in the context of Lit components has broadened my toolkit for creating robust and efficient web applications. This journey has not only deepened my understanding of Lit components but has also provided valuable insights into the broader landscape of modern web development


### Continued development

My next goal is to enhance this project with a comprehensive suite of unit tests.
This journey will not only strengthen the reliability of the code but also provide a fantastic opportunity for me to delve into the intricacies of testing in the context of web components.
